<!-- Tricks to keep in mind when doing simulations in R: First, organize everything in a tibble. This makes it easy to see what is going on. Often, we will first make sure that the code is working with a small tibble with just a few rows and selected values for the key variables. Then, when that looks good, run it for real with x = 1:100 or whatever. -->

<!-- Second, build the tibble column-by-column. We will often start with an ID column whose only purpose is to set up the size of the tibble. Then, we add new columns with mutate(). Often, we add one column and then use that column as input to a map function which adds another column and then use that column to do something else. Read the examples in Chapter 6 closely. -->

<!-- Third, recall that map() returns a list, which allows you to create a list-column. This is very handy. Let's say you want to get the sum of 6 rolls from a dice. Instead of doing a roll in each row and then summing the rows --- which can work but which can also be a bother --- use something like `mutate(six_rolls = map(ID, ~  roll_die(n = 6))` to get a list of the 6 rolls. You can then manipulate six rolls, which is a list-column, in subsequent steps. -->

## Introduction
### 

This tutorial covers [Chapter 2: Probability](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/probability.html) of [*Preceptor’s Primer for Bayesian Data Science: Using the Cardinal Virtues for Inference*](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/) by [David Kane](https://davidkane.info/). 

This tutorial will review 5 key lessons:
  1. Learn about `list()` ,`map()`, `map_*()`, and `tibble()` functions.
  2. Practice using `tibble()`, `mutate()`,`map_*()`, `rep()` and `sample()` to generate data.
  3. Learn about different types of distribution.
  4. Create distributions using tools above and from earlier chapters.
  5. Start thinking about the meaning of each distribution by looking at each graph.

## Distributions
### 

Let's create this normal distribution by the end of this section.

```{r distributions-0}
shoesize_p <- tibble(Wshoes = rnorm(n = 100000, mean = 8, sd = 1.5),
       Mshoes = rnorm(n = 100000, mean = 10.5, sd = 1.5)) |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), 
               names_to = "distribution", 
               values_to = "value") |>  
   ggplot(aes(x = value, fill = distribution)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),
                   alpha = 0.5, 
                   bins = 100, 
                   position = "identity") +
    labs(title = "Normal Distributions of shoe sizes",
         x = "Value",
         y = "Probability")

shoesize_p
```

### Exercise 1

Create a `tibble`, with one variable `numbers`, and set `numbers` equal to the consecutive integers from 1 to 101 inclusive.

```{r distributions-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r distributions-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
tibble(numbers = 1:101)
```

### 

Note that the vector of `numbers` is integers, if you try putting `c()` around the two numbers, and
replace `:` with comma, the two numbers become `double` instead.

### Exercise 2

Pipe the results and then use `summarise()`, create a new column name `avg` which is equal to the `mean()` of `numbers`.

```{r distributions-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r distributions-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...|>
  summarize(avg = mean(...))
```

### 

`summarise()` does not keep any of the variables in the input tibble, unless the `.by` argument is used.

### Exercise 3

Within the `summarise()`, add a new argument separate by comma, `middle`, and set Median equal to the median of `numbers` using `median()`.

```{r distributions-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r distributions-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
tibble(numbers = 1:101) |> 
  summarise(avg = mean(numbers),
            middle = median(numbers))
```

### 

Both `mean()` and `median()` have the `na.rm` value set to its default `FALSE`, the `na.rm` means the function does not consider NA value in the tibble.

### Exercise 4

Within the `summarise()`, add a new argument separate by comma, `stan_dev`, and then set `stan_dev` equal to the standard deviation of `numbers` using sd().Recall standard deviation is measuring how spread out our numbers are.

```{r distributions-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r distributions-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
tibble(numbers = 1:101) |> 
  summarise(avg = mean(...),
            middle = median(...),
            stan_dev = sd(...))
```

### 

Note that the x value inside `mean()` ,`median()` and `sd()` has to be a numeric vector, not a factor or logical. 

### Exercise 5

Within the `summarise()`, add a new argument separated by comma, `med_dev`, and set mad equal to the median absolute deviation of `numbers` using `mad()`. 

```{r distributions-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r distributions-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
tibble(numbers = 1:100) |> 
  summarise(avg = mean(...),
            middle = median(...),
            stan_dev = sd(...),
            med_dev = mad(...))
```

### 

`mad` stands for median absolute deviation, essentially it's how spread out the values are around the median, note that the number should be different in this case. `sd()` is looking for the square of difference, yet `mad()` is looking at the absolute difference.

### Exercise 6

Last but not least, within `summarise()`, add `quantile`, use `quantile()`. Within it, set the first argument to `numbers`, and the second to `prob` which is equal to `c(0, 0.5, 1)`.

```{r distributions-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r distributions-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
tibble(numbers = 1:100) |> 
  summarise(Mean = mean(numbers),
            Median = median(numbers),
            sd = sd(numbers),
            mad = mad (numbers),
            quantile = quantile(numbers , prob = c(0 ,0.5, 1)))
```

### 

This will create another two rows, because quantile has three values in it's column, yet if we want to keep it in one rows, we can add `list()` around `quantile()`, so that we create a list-column for column quantile and keep everything else in 1 row.

### Exercise 7

Start a new pipe using `tibble()`, make the first column name as `ID`, and set it equal to the consecutive integer from 1 to 100. Then make a second column named `scores`, and set it equal using `rep()` where value `1350` occurs 20 times, value `1380` occurs 30 times, `1440` occurs 40 times, and `1520` occurs 10 times. Remember to group the `rep()` together using `c()`.

```{r distributions-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r distributions-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
tibble(ID = ... , scores = c(rep(1350, ...),
                             rep(1380, ...),
                             rep(1440, ...),
                             rep(1520, ...)))
```

### 

We can use `c()` to combine the `rep()` of numbers into vectors, and within `tibble()` or `mutate()` we can turn this vector into a column.

### Exercise 8

Now let's say you are an admissions officer, and here's the score, now you want to look at the percentile of that score. Use the summarize function to make a new column called "percentile", and set equal to `quantile()`, first argument is scores, the second is `prob`, and set it equal to (.35, .50, .75).

```{r distributions-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r distributions-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
tibble(ID = 1:100 , scores = c(rep(1350, ...),
                               rep(1380, ...),
                               rep(1440, ...),
                               rep(1520, ...))) |>
  summarise(percentile = quantile(scores, prob = c(.35, .50, .75)))
```

### 

Function `quantile()` produces sample quantiles corresponding to the given probabilities. The smallest observation corresponds to a probability of 0 and the largest to a probability of 1.

### Exercise 9

Now let's say instead of looking at the percentile you want to randomly pick 10 people from 1350 to 1520 score range to admit. Within `summarise()`, replace `percentile` to `admit`, and set it equal to `sample()`, within `sample()`, the first argument is `scores`, second set `size` equal to 10, and third `replace` which you set to `FALSE`.

```{r distributions-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r distributions-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
tibble(ID = 1:100 , scores = c(rep(1350, ...),
                               rep(1380, ...),
                               rep(1440, ...),
                               rep(1520, ...))) |>
  summarise( admit = sample(scores, size = ..., replace = ...))
```

### 

Within `sample()`, the first argument represents the data source, `size` means the number of values we are picking, and `replace` means whether we pick the same value twice.

### Exercise 10

Let's now use `runif()` to draw from a uniform distribution. Within `runif()`, set `n` to 5 (the number of draws), `min` to 5, and `max` to 8. 

```{r distributions-10, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r distributions-10-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
runif(n = ..., min = ..., max =...)
```

### 

The [runif](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-random-deviates-of-uniform-distribution-in-r-programming-runif-function/) function creates a random uniform distribution between your chosen minimum and maximum values.

### Exercise 11

Start a pipe with `tibble()`, set the value `heads` equals to `rbinom()`, with the first argument equal to 1000, second argument `size` equal to 1, and the third argument `prob` equal to 0.5.

```{r distributions-11, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r distributions-11-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
tibble(heads = rbinom(n = 1000, size = 1, prob = 0.5))
```

### 

`rbinom()` is used for the scenario where there is only two possible outcome also known as Boolean data type, the coin toss in this case is an example of Boolean data. Within `rbinom()` the value `n` means how many value is draw, `size` is how many value draws each time, and `prob` is the probability of the outcome.

### Exercise 12

We can give a quick look at what the graph looks like, pipe down the `tibble()` and add `ggplot()`, within `ggplot()`, use `aes()` and set `x =  heads`, then add the layer geom_bar()`.

```{r distributions-12, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r distributions-12-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
tibble(heads = rbinom(n = 1000, size = 1, prob = 0.5)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = heads))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5)
```

### 

In this case `geom_col()` won't work because it need an y aesthetic, `geom_bar()` is better than `geom_histogram()` in this scenario because `geom_bar()` automatically fixes the `binwidth` for you, while `geom_histogram()` requires you to set the `binwidth` yourself. 
### Exercise 13

Start a pipe with `tibble()`, create an value `Wshoes`, set it equal to `rnorm()`, set the first argument to 100000, the second argument `mean` equal to 8, and third argument `sd` to 1.5. Create another value `Mshoes`, set it equal to `rnorm()`, set the first argument to 100000, the second argument `mean` equal to 10.5, and third argument `sd` to 1.5.

```{r distributions-13, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r distributions-13-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
tibble(Wshoes = rnorm(100000, mean = 8, sd = 1.5),
       Mshoes = rnorm(100000, mean = 10.5, sd = 1.5))
```

### 

Within `rnorm()` the first argument means how many times we are drawing, the second argument `mean` is the mean of the distribution, and the third argument `sd` is the standard deviation for the distribution. Normal distribution is mostly used for things that are very common for most people, but uncommon as they get far away from their average value. Examples could be height, blood pressure, IQ value, shoe sizes, etc.

### Exercise 14

Let's prepare to plot our tibble.  Use `|>` to add the function `pivot_longer()`. Set `cols` to `everything()`, `names_to` to "Distribution", and `values_to` to  "draw".

```{r distributions-14, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r distributions-14-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
    pivot_longer(cols = ...,
                 names_to = ...,
                 values to = ...)
```

### 

`pivot_longer()` "lengthens" data, increasing the number of rows and decreasing the number of columns. The inverse transformation is `pivot_wider()`

### Exercise 15

Continue your pipe with `ggplot()` to map `x` to `draw` and `fill` to Distribution. Add the layer `geom_histogram()`. Within `geom_histogram()`, use `aes()` to add aesthetic with `after_stat()` . Inside `aes()`, set `y` equals to `after_stat()` with `count/sum(count)` to put percents on the y-axis.

```{r distributions-15, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r distributions-15-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))))
```

### Exercise 16

Set `alpha` to .5, `bins` to 100, and `position` to "identity" within `geom_histogram()`.

```{r distributions-16, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r distributions-16-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
   geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),
                  alpha =  ..., 
                  bins =  ..., 
                  position = ...)
```

### Exercise 17

Finally, use `labs()` to title your graph "Normal Distributions of shoe sizes". Also label your x-axis "Value" and y-axis "Probability".
```{r distributions-17, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

Reminder: This is what your plot should look like.

## PDs With Flipping a Coin 
### 

Let's create the following *empirical distribution* of flipping a fair coin. Recall, that empirical distribution is based on data therefore we need to simulate our data, that is "flipping the coin" by ourselves.

```{r}
emp_p <- 
  tibble(results = sample(c(0, 1), 100, replace = TRUE)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = results)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))), 
                   binwidth = 0.5, 
                   color = "white") +
    labs(title = "Empirical Probability Distribution",
         subtitle = "Flipping one coin a hundred times",
         x = "Outcome\nResult of Coin Flip",
         y = "Probability") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 1), 
                       labels = c("Heads", "Tails")) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = 
                         scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
    theme_classic()

emp_p
```

### Exercise 1

Let's simulate flipping a coin, use `sample()`, within `sample()`, set the first argument to 0 and 1, where 0 represent tails and 1 represent heads, second argument to repeat 100 times, and third argument set `replace` equal to `TRUE`, so that we can generate different values.

```{r pds-with-flipping-a-coin-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r pds-with-flipping-a-coin-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
sample(..., ... , replace = ...)
```

```{r pds-with-flipping-a-coin-1-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
sample(c(..., ...), 100, replace = TRUE)
```

### 

Essentially we are flipping a coin 100 times on our own on the computer. This is one way we can get access to our *population*, which contains all the data we need.

### Exercise 2

Create a `tibble()` with one variable `results` . Have `results` take on the values of the `sample()` code in the previous exercise.  

```{r pds-with-flipping-a-coin-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r pds-with-flipping-a-coin-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
tibble(... = sample(..., ..., ...))
```

### 

`sample()` is what we always use in flipping coins, rolling dice, and other simple probability problems, where we can pick a value and repeat it as many times as we want.

### Exercise 3

Pipe your results to `ggplot()`. Map `results` to the x-axis. Also add the layer `geom_histogram()`. 

```{r pds-with-flipping-a-coin-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r pds-with-flipping-a-coin-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(...) + 
  geom_histogram()
```

The `aes()` within `geom_histogram()` can only be either `x` or `y`, if you want to use both of them, use `geom_col()` or `geom_bar()` instead.

### Exercise 4

Within `geom_histogram()`, use `after_stat()` . Inside `aes()`, use `after_stat()` with the argument `y =count/sum(count)` to put percents on the y-axis.

```{r pds-with-flipping-a-coin-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r pds-with-flipping-a-coin-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(...) 
```

### 

There are three stages where you can put aesthetic, `aes()`: first the the normal or default stage that is we set the `aes()` within ggplot, the second stage is after the data is transformed by layers like in geom_histogram(), and the third stage is after the data has been transformed and scaled. Therefore, `after_stat()` is a function we use in the second stage, and it's family function `after_scale()` is used in the third stage.

### Exercise 5

Also set `binwidth` to .5 and `color` to "white" within `geom_histrogram()`.

```{r pds-with-flipping-a-coin-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r pds-with-flipping-a-coin-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),
                 binwidth = 0.5,
                 color = "white")
```

### 

The color argument within geom_histogram(), determines the color of the bar's framework, it helps us to separate the bars from one another. To change the color of the bar, we would use the argument fill instead of color. 

### Exercise 6

Now use `scale_x_continuous()` so the x-axis has `breaks` at 0 and 1. Set the `labels` for the breaks as "Heads" and "Tails", respectively. 

```{r pds-with-flipping-a-coin-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r pds-with-flipping-a-coin-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
Use the c() function for specifying the breaks and labels.
```

```{r pds-with-flipping-a-coin-6-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(..., ...),
                     labels = c(..., ...))
```

To determine whether to use scale_x_continuous or scale_x_discrete, you need to determine the vector of the variable you want to plot. If your variable is numeric, then use `scale_x_continuous()`, if your variable is factor, then use `scale_x_discrete()`.

### Exercise 7

Now use `scale_y_continuous()` to put the y-axis in percent format. Within `scale_y_continuous()`, set `labels` to `scales::percent_format()`. Within `percent_format()` set `accuracy` to 1.

```{r pds-with-flipping-a-coin-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r pds-with-flipping-a-coin-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(...))
```

There is alot more function within scale_y_continuous, includes the limit, expand, guide, position, etc. To learn more about scale_continuous, click [here] (https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_continuous.html)

### Exercise 8

Finally, use `labs()` to add the appropriate title, subtitle, and axis labels.

```{r pds-with-flipping-a-coin-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

Reminder: Your plot should look similar to the the one below. **Note**: the height of the bars will vary because our `rbinom()` statements generate different proportions every time! If we used the function `set.seed()` then we would be able to replicate our results. Learn more about set.seed [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/why-we-should-use-set-seed-in-r).

### 

Remember the *empirical distribution* is grabbing data out of the *population*. *Population* is the imaginary urn from which our data has been, or will be drawn. 

## PDs With Rolling Two Dice
### 

Let's create the following *empirical distribution* for rolling two dice.

```{r}
set.seed(1)

emp_dist_dice <- tibble(ID = 1:100) |> 
  mutate(die_1 = map_dbl(ID, ~ sample(c(1:6), size = 1))) |> 
  mutate(die_2 = map_dbl(ID, ~ sample(c(1:6), size = 1))) |> 
  mutate(sum = die_1 + die_2) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = sum)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))), 
                   binwidth = 1, 
                   color = "white") +
    labs(title = "Empirical Probability Distribution",
         subtitle = "Sum from rolling two dice, replicated one hundred times",
         x = "Outcome\nSum of Two Die",
         y = "Probability") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2, 12, 1), labels = 2:12) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = 
                         scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
    theme_classic()

emp_dist_dice
```

### Exercise 1

Create a `tibble()` with variable `ID`, and the we make a list of values from 1 to 100 for the variable `ID`.

```{r pds-with-rolling-two-dice-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r pds-with-rolling-two-dice-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
tibble(ID = ... : ...)
```

```{r pds-with-rolling-two-dice-1-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
tibble(ID = 1:100)
```

### 

`tibble()` function provides us a framework to generate our data, this function will be used throughout this tutorial.

### Exercise 2

Nice! Now let's pipe down the tibble we create in the last exercise, let's use the `map_dbl` function to create the results for an random dice rolling experiment. recalled the` map() and map_*()` functions, within it it will includes two argument one is the data source, which in this case is `ID`. and the formula we want to use to create the dice result is the `sample()` function, and use the argument `size` within the `sample()` function to only pick one out of the six faces of a standard dice.

```{r pds-with-rolling-two-dice-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r pds-with-rolling-two-dice-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...|>
map_dbl(..., ~...)
```

```{r pds-with-rolling-two-dice-2-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
...|>
map_dbl(ID, ~sample(c(...:...), size = 1))
```

This may return an error, but you may still continue on to the next exercise where the code should run without any errors.

### Exercise 3

Nice! Now let's pipe down the above and use the `mutate()` function to assign the `map_dbl` functions we above to an value called "die_1".

```{r pds-with-rolling-two-dice-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r pds-with-rolling-two-dice-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...|>
mutate(... =map_dbl(ID, ~sample(c(...:...), size = 1)))
```

```{r pds-with-rolling-two-dice-3-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
...|>
mutate(die_1 = map_dbl(ID, ~ sample(c(1:6), size = 1))) |> 
```

### Exercise 4

Now copy and paste the results from above, and do the exact same thing again but instead row named to value to `die_2`, because we need the results for two dices.

```{r pds-with-rolling-two-dice-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r pds-with-rolling-two-dice-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...|>
mutate(... =map_dbl(ID, ~sample(c(...:...), size = 1)))
```

```{r pds-with-rolling-two-dice-4-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
...|>
mutate(die_2 = map_dbl(ID, ~ sample(c(1:6), size = 1))) |> 
```

### Exercise 5

Use the `mutate()` function once again, name the value of the sum of `die_1` and `die_2` to "sum"

```{r pds-with-rolling-two-dice-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r pds-with-rolling-two-dice-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...|>
mutate(sum = die_1 + die_2)
```

### Exercise 6

Copy and paste the results from above, now use `ggplot()` to graph the Empirical Distribution, set `x = sum` within `aes()`, and then add a layer of `geom_histogram()`

```{r pds-with-rolling-two-dice-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r pds-with-rolling-two-dice-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...|>
ggplot(aes())+
  geom_histogram()
```

### Exercise 7

Within `geom_histogram()`, use `after_stat()` . Inside `aes()`, use `after_stat()` with the argument `y =count/sum(count)` to put percents on the y-axis.

```{r pds-with-rolling-two-dice-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r pds-with-rolling-two-dice-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(...)))
```

### Exercise 8

Also set `binwidth` to .5 and `color` to "white" within `geom_histrogram()`.

```{r pds-with-rolling-two-dice-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r pds-with-rolling-two-dice-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))), 
                   binwidth = 1, 
                   color = "white") 
```

### Exercise 9

Now use `scale_x_continuous()` so the x-axis has `breaks` to the sequence between 2 and 12 common difference is 1 using `seq()`. Set the `labels` for the breaks from 2 to 12.

```{r pds-with-rolling-two-dice-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r pds-with-rolling-two-dice-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(...,..., ...), labels = ...:...) 
```

```{r pds-with-rolling-two-dice-9-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2, 12, 1), labels = 2:12) 
```

### Exercise 10

Now use `scale_y_continuous()` to put the x-axis in percent format. Within `scale_y_continuous()`, set `labels` to `scales::percent_format()`. Within `percent_format()` set `accuracy` to 1.

```{r pds-with-rolling-two-dice-10, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r pds-with-rolling-two-dice-10-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(...))
```

### Exercise 11

Finally, use `labs()` to add the appropriate title, subtitle, and axis labels. Also add the layer `theme_classic()`.

```{r pds-with-rolling-two-dice-11, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

## PDs With Engine Displacement
### 

Let's create the following *empirical distribution* about the "engine displacement of the next front-wheel drive car you'll see" using the data from the `mpg` dataset.

```{r}
emp_mpg <- mpg |>
  filter(drv == "f", cty >= 16) |>
  select(displ)|>
  drop_na() |>
  ggplot(aes(x = displ)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))), 
                 binwidth = 1, 
                 color = "white")+
  labs(title = "Empirical Probability Distribution",
       subtitle = "Engine Displacement for front-wheel drive cars from mpg",
       x = "Engine Displacement",
       y = "Probability",caption = "Source:mpg") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels =
                      scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  theme_classic()

emp_mpg
```

### Exercise 1

Run `glimpse()` on `mpg`.

```{r pds-with-engine-displacement-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r pds-with-engine-displacement-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
glimpse(...)
```

There are all sorts of columns in this data set, but the two that we actually care about are `drv` and `cty`.
 
### Exercise 2

Start a new pipe with `mpg`, use `filter()` to filter the rows where `drv` is equal to `"f"`, and `cty` is greater than or equal to `16`.

```{r pds-with-engine-displacement-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r pds-with-engine-displacement-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
mpg |>
  filter(drv == ..., cty >= ...) 
```

```{r pds-with-engine-displacement-2-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
mpg |>
  filter(drv == "f", cty >= 16) 
```

### Exercise 3

Use `select()` to pick out "displ" column which is what we want. Then use `drop_na()` to drop the rows that contains NA which we don't want. 
```{r pds-with-engine-displacement-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r pds-with-engine-displacement-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...|>
  select(...)|>
  drop_na()
```

### Exercise 4

Use `ggplot()` and `geom_histogram()` to graph out the distribution, set x equal to "displ" within `ggplot()`.

```{r pds-with-engine-displacement-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r pds-with-engine-displacement-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...|>
  ggplot(aes(x = ...)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

### Exercise 5

Within `geom_histogram()`, use `aes()` . Inside `aes()`, set `y` equal to `after_stat()` with the argument `count/sum(count)` to put percents on the y-axis.

```{r pds-with-engine-displacement-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r pds-with-engine-displacement-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
    geom_histogram(aes(... = after_stat(...))) 
```

### Exercise 6

Also set `binwidth` to .5 and `color` to "white" within `geom_histrogram()`.

```{r pds-with-engine-displacement-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r pds-with-engine-displacement-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))), 
                   binwidth = ..., 
                   ... = "white") 
```

### Exercise 7

Now use `scale_y_continuous()` to put the y-axis in percent format. Within `scale_y_continuous()`, set `labels` to `scales::percent_format()`. Within `percent_format()` set `accuracy` to 1.

```{r pds-with-engine-displacement-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r pds-with-engine-displacement-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  scale_y_continuous(... = scales::percent_format(...))
```

### Exercise 8

Finally, use `labs()` to add the appropriate title, subtitle, axis labels, and caption. Also add the layer `theme_classic()`.

```{r pds-with-engine-displacement-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

Reminder: Your plot should look exactly like this one because we used the exact same data from mpg.

```{r}
emp_mpg
```

## List-columns and map functions
### 

We need to expand our collection of R tricks by learning about list-columns and `map_*` functions. Recall that a list is different from an atomic vector. In atomic vectors, each element of the vector has the same type. Lists, however, can contain objects of different types, including vectors and even more complex object, such as elements.

### Exercise 1

Use `c()` to combine the following numbers : 4, 16, 9

```{r listcolumns-and-map-functions-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r listcolumns-and-map-functions-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
c(..., ..., ...)
```

### 

`c()` combines its arguments to form a vector. 

### Exercise 2

Now use `c()` to combine two letters ("A" and "Z") into a single vector.

```{r listcolumns-and-map-functions-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r listcolumns-and-map-functions-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
c(..., ...)
```

```{r listcolumns-and-map-functions-2-test, include = FALSE}
c("A", "Z")
```

### 

`c()` is the most commonly used function for creating vectors.

### Exercise 3

Create a `list()` with two elements: the first element is the combine numbers from first exercise and the second is the combine letters from second exercise.

```{r listcolumns-and-map-functions-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r listcolumns-and-map-functions-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
list(c(...), c(...))
```

```{r listcolumns-and-map-functions-3-test, include = FALSE}
list(c(4, 16, 9), c("A", "Z"))
```

### 

Any function that returns multiple values can be used to create a list output by wrapping that returned object with `list()`.

### Exercise 4

Now assign the list we just created to a variable `x`, then run `x[[1]]`. It should returns the first element which are the 3 numbers.

```{r listcolumns-and-map-functions-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r listcolumns-and-map-functions-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
x <- list(c(...),c(...))
x[[...]]
```

```{r listcolumns-and-map-functions-4-test, include = FALSE}
x <- list(c(4, 16, 9), c("A", "Z"))
x[[1]]
```

### 

We use `[[]]` to extract specific elements.

### Exercise 5

Use `rnorm()` to generate a vector of 10 random numbers, with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. 

```{r listcolumns-and-map-functions-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r listcolumns-and-map-functions-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
rnorm(10)
```

### 

You could do something like `rnorm(n = 10, mean = 0, sd = 1)`, but since we are using the default values of `mean` and `sd`, we can simply do `rnorm(10)`.

### Exercise 6

Use the `range()` to calculate the range of `rnorm(10)`.

```{r listcolumns-and-map-functions-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r listcolumns-and-map-functions-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
range(rnorm(10))
```

### 

`range()` returns a *vector* containing the minimum and maximum of all the given arguments.

### Exercise 7

Run `list()` with `range(rnorm(10)` as its only input.

```{r listcolumns-and-map-functions-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r listcolumns-and-map-functions-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
list(range(rnorm(...)))
```

```{r listcolumns-and-map-functions-7-test, include = FALSE}
list(range(rnorm(10)))
```

### 

In both this question and the previous one, we used `list()` to create an object with two elements. To learn more about [How To Work With List Columns](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/how-to-work-with-list-columns/)

### Exercise 8

<!-- DK: Sloppy. -->

Now take the list we created above and assign it into a tibble using `tibble()` in which the column name is `col_1`.

```{r listcolumns-and-map-functions-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r listcolumns-and-map-functions-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
tibble(col_1 = list(range(rnorm(...))))
```

### 

Now you have created a list-column which is a 1-by-1 tibble with one observation, which is a list of one element.

### Exercise 9

Pipe down your result, use `map_dbl()`to create and work with the list-column we create. Within `map_dbl()`, set the first argument to `col_1`, the second to the formula that calculate the sum of the range in col_1 using `sum()`, don't forget the `~` before formula, and the `.` within `sum()`.

```{r listcolumns-and-map-functions-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r listcolumns-and-map-functions-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
tibble(col_1 = list(range(rnorm(10)))) |> 
  mutate(col_2= map_dbl(col_1, ~sum(.)))
```

### 

We can replace the `~ sum(.)` to simply sum as a statement, but we generally work with formulas more often, so we practice using `~ sum(.)` instead.

### Exercise 10

Let's try using other map_* functions, use `map_int()` to set the first argument to col_1, replace `sum()` with `length()`, and assign the `map_int()` to a new column `col_3`.

```{r listcolumns-and-map-functions-10, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r listcolumns-and-map-functions-10-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
tibble(col_1 = list(range(rnorm(10)))) |> 
  mutate(col_2= map_dbl(col_1, ~sum(.))) |>
  mutate(col_3= map_int(col_1, ~length(.)))
```

### 

Again if we replace `~ length(.)` with just `length`, we would got the same result.

### Exercise 11

Let's try using other map_* functions, use `map_chr()` set the first argument to col_1, replace `length()` with `mean()`, and assign the `map_chr()` to a new column `col_4`.

```{r listcolumns-and-map-functions-11, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r listcolumns-and-map-functions-11-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
tibble(col_1 = list(range(rnorm(10)))) |> 
  mutate(col_2= map_dbl(col_1, ~sum(.))) |>
  mutate(col_3= map_int(col_1, ~length(.)))|>
  mutate(col_4= map_chr(col_1, ~mean(.)))
```

### 

The reason for why we are doing these in almost the same exercise is to show you how different map_* functions would return different vectors for the new column we create. To learn more about the other map functions check [Map Functions](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html?q=map#the-map-functions).

### Exercise 12

Create a tibble using `tibble()`, set the first column `ID` equal to a set of integers from 1 to 10. 

```{r listcolumns-and-map-functions-12, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r listcolumns-and-map-functions-12-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
tibble(ID= 1:10)
```

### 

We can get the consecutive integers we want by using `:` instead of `c()`.

### Exercise 13

Use `mutate()` to create a new column called `N`, set n equal an value from 10 random values in which the mean is 0 and standard deviation is 1. 

```{r listcolumns-and-map-functions-13, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r listcolumns-and-map-functions-13-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
tibble(ID = 1:10) |>
  mutate(N = sample(rnorm(10),size=1))
```

### 

Note how all `N` is equal, essentially what happened here is `N` calculates it self using the `sample()` function and copies it 10 times to match the `ID` column.

### Exercise 14

Create an new column called `Y` using `mutate()`, this time use `map_dbl()`, set the first argument to `ID` to represent the data source, the second argument to the `sample()` *Formula* we created in the last exercise.

```{r listcolumns-and-map-functions-14, exercise = TRUE}

```

Remember for formula we always add the `~` at front. 

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r listcolumns-and-map-functions-14-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
tibble(ID = 1:10) |>
  mutate(N = sample(rnorm(10),size=1)) |>
  mutate(Y = map_dbl(ID, ~ sample(rnorm(...),size=...)))
```

### 

When we add on the `map_* ()` function to the mutate, it grabs the data, in this case `ID`, and it deals with each one of the data using the formula in the second statement `~sample()`, that's why we would get different results for each ID in the Y column but not in the `N` column.

## Two Models
### 

In a basic scenario, there are two models: either you have Probaphobia (fear of probability) or you don't. We're uncertain which one applies, but these are the only possibilities.

### 

Let's create the following *joint and conditional* probability tibble about Probaphobia. There is then a 50% chance that you test positive and a 50% chance you test negative.

```{r}
jd_disease <- tibble(ID = 1:10000, 
                     have_disease = rep(c(TRUE, FALSE), 
                                        5000)) |>
  mutate(positive_test = if_else(have_disease,
                                 map_int(have_disease, ~ rbinom(n = 1, size = 1, p = 0.99)),
                                 map_int(have_disease, ~ rbinom(n = 1, size = 1, p = 0.5))))

jd_disease
```

### Exercise 1

Use `tibble()` and set `ID` from 1 to 10000.

```{r two-models-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r two-models-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
tibble(ID = ...)
```

```{r two-models-1-test, include = FALSE}
tibble(ID = 1:1000)
```

### 

The first step is to simply create an tibble that consists of the simulated data we need to plot our distribution. 

### Exercise 2

Within the `tibble()` set `have_disease` to `rep(c(TRUE, FALSE), 5000)`.

```{r two-models-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r two-models-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
tibble(..., have_disease = rep(c(TRUE, FALSE), 5000))
```

```{r two-models-2-test, include = FALSE}
tibble(ID = 1:10000, 
                     have_disease = rep(c(TRUE, FALSE), 
                                        5000))
```

### 

We have two different probabilities and they are completely separate from each other and we want to keep the two probabilities and the disease results in two and only two columns so that we can graph using the `ggplot()` function.

### Exercise 3

Start a pipe with the above code and `mutate()` with `positive_test` set to `if_else(have_disease)`.

```{r two-models-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r two-models-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  mutate(positive_test = if_else(...))
```

```{r two-models-3-test, include = FALSE}
# tibble(ID = 1:10000, 
#        have_disease = rep(c(TRUE,FALSE), 5000)) |>
#   mutate(positive_test = if_else(have_disease))
```

### Exercise 4

Finally let's add two `map_int()`'s with `have_disease` and `rbinom()`. In `rbinom()` set `n` to 1, `size` to 1, and `prob` to 0.99 for the first and 0.5 for the second.

```{r two-models-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r two-models-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  mutate(...,
         map_int(..., ~ rbinom(n = 1, size = ..., p = 0.99)),
         map_int(..., ~ rbinom(n = 1, size = ..., p = 0.5))))
```

```{r two-models-4-test, include = FALSE}
# tibble(ID = 1:10000, have_disease = rep(c(TRUE,FALSE), 5000)) |>
#   mutate(positive_test = if_else(have_disease),
#          map_int(have_disease ~ rbinom(n = 1, size = 1, p = .99)),
#          map_int(have_disease ~ rbinom(n = 1, size = 1, p = .05)))
```

### 

We use the `rep` and `seq` functions when creating the table. The `seq` function sets the sequence we wants, in this case it is only two numbers, 0.01 (99% accuracy for testing negative if no disease, therefore 1% for testing positive if no disease) and 0.5 (50% accuracy for testing positive/negative if have disease), then we used the `rep` functions to repeat the process 10,000 times for each probability, in total 20,000 times.

### Exercise 5

Take the above code and set it to the `jd_disease` variable.

```{r two-models-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r two-models-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
jd_disease <- ... 
```

```{r two-models-5-test, include = FALSE}
# jd_disease <- tibble(ID = 1:10000, have_disease = rep(c(TRUE,FALSE), 5000)) |>
#   mutate(positive_test = if_else(have_disease),
#          map_int(have_disease ~ rbinom(n = 1, size = 1, p = .99)),
#          map_int(have_disease ~ rbinom(n = 1, size = 1, p = .05)))
```

### Exercise 6

Let's create an *unnormalized conditional distribution*. Start a pipe with the `jd_disease` to `filter()` and only include `positive_test` equal to 1.

```{r two-models-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r two-models-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  filter(... == 1)
```

```{r two-models-6-test, include = FALSE}
# jd_disease <- tibble(ID = 1:10000, have_disease = rep(c(TRUE,FALSE), 5000)) |>
#   mutate(positive_test = if_else(have_disease),
#          map_int(have_disease ~ rbinom(n = 1, size = 1, p = .99)),
#          map_int(have_disease ~ rbinom(n = 1, size = 1, p = .05)))
# jd_disease |>
#   filter(positive_test == 1)
```

### 

Since the test is not always accurate, you cannot be 100% certain that you have it. Here we are isolating the slice where the test result equals 1 (meaning positive).

### Exercise 7

Continue the pipe from above and `ggplot()` and within `aes()` set `x` to `have_disease`.

```{r two-models-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r two-models-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = ...))
```

```{r two-models-7-test, include = FALSE}
# jd_disease <- tibble(ID = 1:10000, have_disease = rep(c(TRUE,FALSE), 5000)) |>
#   mutate(positive_test = if_else(have_disease),
#          map_int(have_disease ~ rbinom(n = 1, size = 1, p = .99)),
#          map_int(have_disease ~ rbinom(n = 1, size = 1, p = .05)))
# jd_disease |>
#   filter(positive_test == 1)|>
#   ggplot(aes(x = have_disease))
```

### Exercise 8

Add `geom_bar()` to the view the following graph.

```{r two-models-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r two-models-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
    ...()
```

### Exercise 9

Now we want to add labels with `labs()`. Set `title` to "Disease Status Given Positive Test", `subtitle` to "Almost all of the cases were infected", `x` to "Disease Status", and `y` to "Count".

```{r two-models-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r two-models-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
    labs(title = ...,
         ... = "Almost all of the cases were infected",
         x = ...,
         y = ...)
```

### Exercise 10

Let's add `scale_x_discrete()` and set `breaks` to `c(FALSE, TRUE)`.

```{r two-models-10, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r two-models-10-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
    scale_x_discrete(... = c(..., ...))
```

### 

We want to change the labels on the bottom of the graph which can be done by recognizing that the `breaks` are `FALSE` and `TRUE` on the bottom.

### Exercise 11

Continue the `scale_x_discrete()` function by adding `labels` set to `c("Healthy", "Infected")`.

```{r two-models-11, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r two-models-11-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
    scale_x_discrete(...,
                     labels = c("Healthy", "Infected"))
```

### 

Through labels we are able to change the label `FALSE` to "Healthy" and `TRUE` to "Infected".

### 

Most people who test positive are infected. This is a result for common diseases like the common cold.

### Exercise 12

Let's use the data from above to create a *conditional distribution*. Add `geom_bar()` and within `aes()` set `y` to `after_stat(count/sum(count))`.

```{r two-models-12, exercise = TRUE}
jd_disease |> 
  filter(positive_test == 1) |> 
  ggplot(aes(have_disease))
```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r two-models-12-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
jd_disease |> 
  filter(positive_test == 1) |> 
  ggplot(aes(have_disease)) +
    geom_bar(aes(y = ...)))
```

### 

`filter()` transforms a *joint distribution* into a *conditional distribution*. We will turn the *unnormalized distribution* into a *posterior probability distribution*.

### Exercise 13

In `geom_bar()` set `color` to "white".

```{r two-models-13, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r two-models-13-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
    geom_bar(aes(y = ...)), 
             color = "white")
```

### 

If we zoom in on the plot, about 70% of people who tested positive have the disease and 30% who tested positive do not have the disease. In this case, we are focusing on the one slice of the probability distribution where the test result was positive.

### Exercise 14

Let's add labels to this graph through `labs()`. Set `title` to "Posterior for Probaphobia Conditional on Positive Test", `x` to "Probaphobia Status", and `y` to "Probability".

```{r two-models-14, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r two-models-14-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
    labs(... = "Posterior for Probaphobia Conditional on Positive Test",
    x = ...,
    y = ...)
```

### Exercise 15

Now we want to add `scale_x_discrete()`. Set `breaks` to `c(FALSE, TRUE)` and `labels` to `c("Healthy", "Infected")`.

```{r two-models-15, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r two-models-15-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
    scale_x_discrete(breaks = c(FALSE, TRUE),
                     labels = c("Healthy", "Infected"))
```

### 

There are two disease outcomes: positive or negative. By isolating a section, we are looking at a *conditional distribution*. Conditional on a positive test, you can visualize the likelihood of actually having the disease versus not.

### Exercise 16

Continue by adding `scale_y_continuous()` and set `labels` to `scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)`.

```{r two-models-16, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r two-models-16-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = ...)
```

### 

With a positive test, you can be almost 70% sure that you have Probaphobia, however there is a good chance about 30% that you receive a false positive, so don’t worry too much there is still about a third of hope that you get the wrong result.

## Three Models 
### 

Let's create the following *joint distribution* of the number of white marbles in a bag and the number of white marbles pulled out in the sample.

```{r}
joint_p <- tibble(in_bag = rep(c(0, 1, 2), 1000)) |>
  mutate(in_sample = map_int(in_bag, ~ rbinom(n = 1, 
                                              size = 3, 
                                              p = ./2))) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = in_sample, y = in_bag)) +
    geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5) +
    labs(title = "Black and White Marbles",
         subtitle = "More white marbles in bag mean more white marbles selected",
         x = "White Marbles Selected",
         y = "White Marbles in the Bag") +
    scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0, 1, 2)) +
  theme_classic()

joint_p
```

### Exercise 1

Create a `tibble()` with one variable `in_bag`. Have `in_bag` take on the values of `rep()`. Within `rep()` use the arguments `0, 1, 2`. 

```{r three-models-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r three-models-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
tibble(in_bag = rep(c(..., ..., ...)))
```

Great. We now have generated the number of white marbles that exist in our bag. 

### Exercise 2

Great. Let's have our code run 1000 times. Add the argument 1000 to `rep()`

```{r three-models-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>


```{r three-models-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
 tibble(in_bag = rep(c(0, 1, 2), ...))
```

### Exercise 3

Use `mutate()`, create a new column name `in_sample`, and set `in_sample` equal to `rbinom()` where `n` is set to 1, `size` is set to 3, and `p` is set to `in_bag/2`. Note that this should returns same values for all 3000 rows under `in_sample`
`
```{r three-models-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r three-models-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
 |>
  mutate(in_sample = rbinom(n = 1, size =3 , p = in_bag/2))
```

### 

This is because `rbinom()` only generate 1 values, so *R* copied and paste that value for all rows to match the 3000 values in the first column.

### Exercise 4

Now set `in_sample` to the function `map_int()`. The first argument to `map_int()` should be `in_bag`. The second argument should be `rbinom()` where `n` is set to 1, `size` is set to 3, and `p` is set to `./2`.

```{r three-models-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r three-models-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  mutate(in_sample = map_int(..., ~ rbinom(..., 
                                           ..., 
                                           ...)))
```

### 

The `.` essentially means carrying the data from the first argument (in_bag) to the operation, it is the same as `in_bag/2`.

### Exercise 5

Pipe your result into `ggpplot()`. Map `in_sample` to the x-axis and `in_bag` to the y-axis. Also add the layer `geom_jitter()`. 

```{r three-models-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r three-models-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = ..., y = ...)) +
    geom_jitter()
```

### Exercise 6

Set `alpha` to .5 within `geom_jitter()`. 

```{r three-models-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>


```{r three-models-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
    geom_jitter(...)
```

### Exercise 7

Now use `scale_y_continuous()` to break the y-axis into three values. Within `scale_y_continuous()`, set `breaks` to 0, 1, and 2.

```{r three-models-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r three-models-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(..., ..., ...)
```

### 

Why do we do this? Each value on the y-axis represents a different version or belief about the world.

### Exercise 8

Finally, use `labs()` to add the appropriate title, subtitle, and axis labels. Also add the layer `theme_classic()`.

```{r three-models-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

Reminder: This is what your plot should look like.

```{r}
joint_p
```

```{r three-models-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  labs(...) +
  theme_classic(...)
```

### 

Awesome. We can now see the number of simulations in each "bucket." Take note that this distribution is normalized.

### 

Let's create the following *unnormalized conditional distribution*. This is essentially a slice of the joint distribution we previously created. 

```{r}
unnorm_p <- tibble(in_bag = rep(c(0, 1, 2), 1000)) |>
  mutate(in_sample = map_int(in_bag, ~ rbinom(n = 1, 
                                              size = 3, 
                                              p = ./2))) |> 
  filter(in_sample == 3) |> 
  ggplot(aes(in_bag)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.25, color = "white") +
    labs(title = "Unnormalized Conditional Distribution",
         subtitle = "Number of white marbles in bag given that three were selected in the sample",
         x = "Number of White Marbles in the Bag",
         y = "Count") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1, 2)) +
    theme_classic()

unnorm_p
```

### Exercise 9

Copy down every part of the empirical distribution before `ggplot()` and then use `filter()` for where `in_sample` is equal to 3.

```{r three-models-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r three-models-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...|> 
  filter(in_sample == ...)
```

### Exercise 10

Pipe your code above to `ggplot()`. Map `in_bag` to the x-axis. Also add the layer `geom_histogram()`.

```{r three-models-10, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r three-models-10-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  ggplot(aes(...)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

### Exercise 11

Set `binwidth` to .25 and `color` to "white" within `geom_histogram()`.

```{r three-models-11, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r three-models-11-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  geom_histogram(..., ...)
```

### Exercise 12

Now use `scale_x_continuous()`. Set `breaks` to `seq()` that contains the values 1 and 2.

```{r three-models-12, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r three-models-12-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  scale_x_continuous(... = seq(..., ...))
```

### Exercise 13

Finally, use `labs()` to add the appropriate title, subtitle, and axis labels. Also add the layer `theme_classic()`.

```{r three-models-13, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

Reminder: This is what your plot should look like.

```{r}
unnorm_p
```

### 

Let's create the following *normalized conditional distribution*. In other words, we are normalizing the graph we just created.

```{r}
norm_p <- tibble(in_bag = rep(c(0, 1, 2), 1000)) |>
  mutate(in_sample = map_int(in_bag, ~ rbinom(n = 1, 
                                              size = 3, 
                                              p = ./2))) |> 
  filter(in_sample == 3) |> 
  ggplot(aes(in_bag)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))), 
                   binwidth = 0.25, 
                   color = "white") +
    labs(title = "Posterior Probability Distribution",
         subtitle = "Number of white marbles in bag given that three were selected in the sample",
         x = "Number of White Marbles in the Bag",
         y = "Probability") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1, 2)) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = 
                         scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
    theme_classic()

norm_p
```

### Exercise 14

We begin our code the same way we began our code for the *unnormalized conditional distribution*. We have provided the code for you below. To begin, within `aes()` use `after_stat()` with the argument `y = count/sum(count)` to put percents on the y-axis.


```{r three-models-14, exercise = TRUE}
tibble(in_bag = rep(c(0, 1, 2), 1000)) |>
  mutate(in_sample = map_int(in_bag, ~ rbinom(n = 1, 
                                              size = 3, 
                                              p = ./2))) |> 
  filter(in_sample == 3) |> 
  ggplot(aes(in_bag)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.25, color = "white")
```

```{r three-models-14-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.25, color = "white",aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count)))
```

### Exercise 15

Now use `scale_x_continuous()` so the x-axis has `breaks` at 1 and 2.

```{r three-models-15, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r three-models-15-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
Use the c() function for specifying the breaks and labels.
```

```{r three-models-15-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(..., ...))
```

### Exercise 16

Now use `scale_y_continuous()` to put the y-axis in percent format. Within `scale_y_continuous()`, set `labels` to `scales::percent_format()`. Within `percent_format()` set `accuracy` to 1.

```{r three-models-16, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r three-models-16-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(...))
```

### Exercise 17

Finally, use `labs()` to add the appropriate title, subtitle, and axis labels. Also add the layer `theme_classic()`.

```{r three-models-17, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

Reminder: This is what your plot should look like.

```

## N Models 
### 

Let's create the following *empirical distribution* for possible simulations for $\rho_h$. In other words, we will create a joint distribution of models which might be true and of data which our experiment might generate. 

```{r}
emp_p <- tibble(p = rep(seq(0, 1, 0.1), 1000)) |>
  mutate(heads = map_int(p, ~ rbinom(n = 1, size = 20, p = .))) |>
  ggplot(aes(y = p, x = heads)) +
    geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1) +
    labs(title = "Empirical Distribution of Number of Heads",
         subtitle = expression(paste("Based on simulations with various values of ", rho[h])),
         x = "Number of Heads out of 20 Tosses",
         y = expression(rho[h])) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1, 0.1)) +
  theme_classic()

emp_p
```

### Exercise 1

Use `tibble()` with one variable `p` set to the function `rep()`. Within `rep()` use the argument `seq()` that takes on the values 0, 1, and .1.

```{r n-models-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r n-models-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
tibble(... = rep(seq(..., ..., ...)))
```

### 

`seq()` generate regular sequences. `seq.int()` is a primitive which can be much faster but has a few restrictions. `seq_along()` and `seq_len()` are very fast primitives for two common cases.

### Exercise 2

Great. Let's have our code run 1000 times. Add the argument 1000 to `rep()`

```{r n-models-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r n-models-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
 tibble(p = rep(c(0, 1, .1), ...))
```

### Exercise 3

Pipe your code to the function `mutate()` to create the variable `heads`. Set `heads` to the function `map_int()`. The first argument to `map_int()` should be `p`. The second argument should be an `rbinom()` where `n` is set to 1, `size` is set to 20, and `p` is set to `.`.

```{r n-models-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r n-models-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
 ... |> 
  mutate(p = map_int(..., ~ rbinom(...,
                                   ..., 
                                   ...)))
```

### 

This `.` means that we are carrying the data source which is `p` and applied it as the probability of our `rbinom()` function.

### Exercise 4

Continue your pipe to `ggplot()`. Map `heads` to the x-axis and `p` to the y-axis. Also add the layer `geom_jitter()`. 

```{r n-models-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r n-models-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
  ggplot(aes(x = ..., y = ...)) +
    geom_jitter()
```

### 

`geom_jitter()` is a convenient shortcut for `geom_point(position = "jitter")`. It adds a small amount of random variation to the location of each point, and is a useful way of handling over-plotting caused by discreteness in smaller datasets.

### Exercise 5

Set `alpha` to .1 within `geom_jitter()`. 

```{r n-models-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r n-models-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  geom_jitter(...)
```

### Exercise 6

Now use `scale_y_continuous()`. Set `breaks` to the function `seq()` that contains the values 0, 1, and .1.

```{r n-models-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r n-models-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(..., ..., ...)
```

### Exercise 7

Finally, use `labs()` to add the appropriate title, subtitle, and axis labels. Also add the layer `theme_classic()`.

```{r n-models-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

Reminder: This is what your plot should look like.

```{r}
emp_p
```

### 

Let's create the following *unnormalized conditional distribution*. This is essentially a slice of the joint distribution we previously created. 

```{r}
unnorm_p <- tibble(p = rep(seq(0, 1, 0.1), 1000)) |>
  mutate(heads = map_int(p, ~ rbinom(n = 1, size = 20, p = .))) |> 
  filter(heads == 8) |> 
  ggplot(aes(p)) +
    geom_bar() +
    labs(title = expression(paste("Values of ", rho[h], " Associated with 8 Heads")),
         x = expression(paste("Assumed value of ", rho[h], " in simulation")),
         y = "Count") +
  theme_classic()

unnorm_p
```

### Exercise 8

Copy the code from exercise 7 upto ggplot. Pipe this to `filter()` for where `heads` is equal to 8.

```{r n-models-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r n-models-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  filter(heads == ...)
```

### Exercise 9

Pipe your code above to `ggplot()`. Map `p` to the x-axis.  Also add the layer `geom_bar()`.

```{r n-models-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r n-models-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  ggplot(aes(...)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

### Exercise 10

Finally, use `labs()` to add the title "Values of P(h) with 8 Heads". Then label your x-axis "Assumed value of P(h) in simulation". Also add the layer `theme_classic()`.

```{r n-models-10, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

Reminder: This is what your plot should look like.

```{r}
unnorm_p
```

### 

Let's create the following *normalized conditional distribution*. In other words, we are normalizing the graph we just created.

```{r}
norm_p <-tibble(p = rep(seq(0, 1, 0.1), 1000)) |>
  mutate(heads = map_int(p, ~ rbinom(n = 1, size = 20, p = .))) |> 
  filter(heads == 8) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = p)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),
                   bins = 50) + 
    labs(title = expression(paste("Posterior Probability Distribution of ", rho[h])),
         x = expression(paste("Possible values for ", rho[h])),
         y = "Probability") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0.2, 0.7, by = 0.1)) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = 
                        scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  theme_classic()

norm_p

```

### Exercise 11

We begin our code the same way we began our code for the *unnormalized conditional distribution*. We have provided the code for you below. To begin, add the layer `geom_histogram()` and set `bins` to 50.

```{r n-models-11, exercise = TRUE}
 tibble(p = rep(seq(0, 1, 0.1), 1000)) |>
  mutate(heads = map_int(p, ~ rbinom(n = 1, size = 20, p = .))) |> 
  filter(heads == 8) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = p))
```

```{r n-models-11-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  geom_histogram(...)
```

### Exercise 12

Within `geom_histogram()`, use `after_stat()`. Inside `aes()` with the argument `y = count/sum(count)` use `after_stat()` to put percents on the y-axis.

```{r n-models-12, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r n-models-12-hint-1, eval = FALSE}

```

### Exercise 13

Now use `scale_x_continuous()`. Set `breaks` to `seq()` that contains the values 0.2 and 0.7. Also set `by` to 0.1 within `seq()`.

```{r n-models-13, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r n-models-13-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  scale_x_continuous(... = seq(..., ..., ...))
```

### Exercise 14

Now use `scale_y_continuous()` to put the y-axis in percent format. Within `scale_y_continuous()`, set `labels` to `scales::percent_format()`. Within `percent_format()` set `accuracy` to 1.

```{r n-models-14, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r n-models-14-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(...))
```

### Exercise 15

Finally, use `labs()` to add the title "Posterior Probability Distribution of P(h)". Then label your x-axis "Possibility values for P(h)" and y-axis "Probability". Also add the layer `theme_classic()`.

```{r n-models-15, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

Reminder: This is what your plot should look like.

```{r}

## Working with PDs with `rbinom()`
### 

Consider *binomial distribution*, the case in which the probability of some Boolean variable (for instance success or failure) is calculated for repeated, independent trials. One common example would be the probability of flipping a coin and landing on heads.

### Exercise 1

Create a `tibble()` and within set `heads` to `rbinom()`.

```{r working-with-pds-with-rbinom-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r working-with-pds-with-rbinom-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
tibble(heads = ...())
```

Note: you will get an error, we will fix this in the next exercise.

### 

The function `rbinom()` allows us to draw from a binomial distribution. This function takes three arguments, `n`, `size`, and `prob`.

### Exercise 2

Within `rbinom()` set `n` to 10000, `size` to 10, and `prob` to 0.5.

```{r working-with-pds-with-rbinom-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r working-with-pds-with-rbinom-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...(... = rbinom(n = ..., ... = 10, prob = ...))
```

### 

`n` is the number of values we seek to draw. `size` is the number of trials for each n. `prob` is the probability of success on each trial.

### Exercise 3

Start a pipe with the above code with `ggplot()` and set `x` to `heads` in `aes()`.

```{r working-with-pds-with-rbinom-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r working-with-pds-with-rbinom-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  ggplot(...(x = ...))
```

### Exercise 4

Add `geom_bar()` to the `ggplot()`.

```{r working-with-pds-with-rbinom-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r working-with-pds-with-rbinom-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  geom_bar()
```

### Exercise 5

Let's add `labs()` to the graph. Set `title` to "Flipping a Fair Coin 10 Times", set `subtitle` to "Extreme results are possible with enough experiments", `x` to "Result", and `y` to "Count".

```{r working-with-pds-with-rbinom-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r working-with-pds-with-rbinom-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  labs(title = ...,
       subtitle = ...,
       x = ...,
       y = ...)
```

### 

Randomness creates (inevitable) tension between distribution as a “thing” and distribution as a vector of draws from that thing. In this case, the vector of draws is not balanced between Tails and Heads. Yet, we “know” that it should be since the coin is, by definition, fair. In a sense, the mathematics require an even split. Yet, randomness means that the vector of draws will rarely match the mathematically “true” result.

### Exercise 6

Add `scale_x_continuous()` with `breaks` set to `c(0, 1)` and `labels` set to `c("Tails", "Heads")`.

```{r working-with-pds-with-rbinom-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r working-with-pds-with-rbinom-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  scales_x_continuous(breaks = ...,
                      labels = ...)
```

### 

In our graph above, we use the function `scale_x_continuous()` because our x-axis variable is continuous, meaning it can take on any real values. The `breaks` argument to `scale_x_continuous()` converts our x-axis to having two different “tick marks”. There is a fairly even distribution of Tails and Heads. More draws would typically result in an even more equal split.

### Exercise 7

Copy the code from above and change `prob` to 0.75 within `rbinom()`.

```{r working-with-pds-with-rbinom-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r working-with-pds-with-rbinom-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
tibble(heads = rbinom(n = 10000, size = 10, prob = ...))
```

### 

Here we can simulate an unfair coin, where the probability of landing on Heads was 0.75 instead of 0.25.

### Exercise 8

Copy the code from above, change the `labels` to unfair instead of fair and change the `scale_x_continuous()` to only include `breaks` which is set to 0:10.

```{r working-with-pds-with-rbinom-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r working-with-pds-with-rbinom-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:10)
```

### 

Here we have a situation in which we are 10,000 times, flipping a unfair coin 10 times. We can see that "Heads" was favored the most throughout the entire flipping. Check out [**binomial distribution**] https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/Binomial.html to learn more about the data involved with binomial distribution.

## Cardinal Virtues with Wisdom
### 

*Wisdom* starts by creating the Preceptor Table. What data, if we had it, would allow us to answer our question easily? If the Preceptor Table has one outcome, then the model is predictive. If it has more than one (potential) outcome, then the model is causal. 

### Exercise 1

Write a one sentence summary for the concept of Preceptor Table.

```{r cardinal-virtues-with-wisdom-1}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "The Preceptor Table is a hypothetical table that contains the necessary rows and columns of data to facilitate the calculation of the quantity of interest in a straightforward manner.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

One key aspect of a Preceptor Table is whether or not we need more than one potential outcome in order to calculate our estimand. For example, if we want to know the causal effect of exposure to Spanish-speakers on attitude toward immigration then we need a causal model, one which estimates that attitude for each person under both treatment and control. 

### Exercise 2

<!-- need to include units/time -->

Write two sentences explaining a predictive model in your life. Include the one outcome variable of interest. 

```{r cardinal-virtues-with-wisdom-2}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "A predictive model in my life can be seen as the money that I will potentially spend on groceries per week. I can take all of the data that I have from the previous weeks to estimate how much I will spend on groceries with a predictive model. Outcome: How much will I spend on groceries?",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

	
A predictive models has just one outcome column in its Preceptor Table.

### Exercise 3

Write two sentences explaining a causal model in your life. Include the two potential outcomes and the treatment variable. 

```{r cardinal-virtues-with-wisdom-3}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "A causal model in my life can be seen as the money that I will spend on groceries based on whether I go to the gym to exercise. Two potential outcomes: dollars spent on groceries if I do go to the gym and dollars spent on groceries if I don't go to the gym. The treatment is going to the gym or not going to the gym. The following situation is an example of a causal model because there are two outcome columns in the Preceptor Table.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

Causal models aim to determine the effect of manipulating a specific variable on the outcome by comparing two or more potential outcomes for each unit. The difference between predictive models and causal models is that the former has one column for the outcome variable in the Preceptor Table and the latter has more than one column.

### Exercise 4

Scenario: You are an analyst at the mayor's office and want to find out what it will take for people to be more kind towards immigrants. You have previous data regarding individuals who were exposed to one of two possible conditions, and then their attitudes towards immigrants were recorded. One condition was waiting on a train platform near individuals speaking Spanish. The other was being on a train platform without Spanish-speakers. You are going to use this data and conduct your own analysis. You will give speeches on citizens through random assignment that includes a positive message regarding immigrants. Your hope is that the causal effect of those speeches is to make people be kinder. 

### 

Is this scenario a predictive model or a causal model? Explain why in two sentences.

```{r cardinal-virtues-with-wisdom-4}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "This scenario is a causal model because there are multiple potential outcomes in the Preceptor Table. Causal models have more than one potential outcome while predictive models only have one outcome.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### Exercise 5

Let's create a Preceptor Table by finding each column needed from the scenario. Write two sentences about what the rows are of the situation and how it relates to the scenario.

```{r cardinal-virtues-with-wisdom-5}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "We are going to use three rows: Citizens, Treatments, and Potential Outcomes. We are concerned about each citizen and the data that each one of them will contain.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### Exercise 6

Write two sentences about what the treatment is of the situation and how it relates to the scenario. 

```{r cardinal-virtues-with-wisdom-6}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "Treatment: Which citizens have heard the speech? We are concerned with the citizens that have/have not heard the speech because it changes whether they are going to be more kind or less kind towards immigrants.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### Exercise 7

Write two sentences about what the *potential outcomes* are of the situation and how it relates to the scenario. Remember this is a causal model which means that there will be multiple potential outcomes. 

```{r cardinal-virtues-with-wisdom-7}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "Potential Outcomes: 
	           1. People who heard the speech and changed to be kind
	           2. People who heard the speech and changed to be not kind              3. People who didn't hear the speech and are kind
	           4. People who didn't hear the speech are not kind
	           These are the four potential outcomes at hand because of              the influence from the treatment that will change the                 outcome of the scenario.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### Exercise 8

How can the *assumption of validity* apply to our scenario? Write one sentence applying this key concept to our situation.

```{r cardinal-virtues-with-wisdom-8}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "The assumption of validity applies to our scenario because we have two similar treatments that can allow for us to predict and use data for our specific situation.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

Validity is the consistency, or lack there of, in the columns of our dataset and the corresponding columns in our Preceptor Table. In order to consider the two datasets to be drawn from the same population, the columns from one must be have a valid correspondence with the columns in the other. 

### Exercise 9

In the first sentence, provide a reason why the *assumption of validity* might not hold with the data from immigrants with Spanish-speakers on the train to our scenario of giving citizens a speech to be more kind. In the second sentence, explain how that failure might impact the results.

```{r cardinal-virtues-with-wisdom-9}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "The treatment in the data (Spanish speakers on a train platform) and the treatment in the Preceptor Table (a speech from the mayor about immigrants) are not similar enough that we can reasonably expect them to have the same causal effects. People are often annoyed by stangers but can react very differently to an elected official.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

*Validity*, if true (or at least reasonable), allows us to construct the Population Table.

## Cardinal Values with Justice
### 

*Justice* starts with the Population Table – the data we want to have, the data which we actually have, and all the other data from that same population. Each row of the Population Table is defined by a unique Unit/Time combination.

### Exercise 1

Write a one sentence summary explaining the concept of the Population Table.

```{r cardinal-values-with-justice-1}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "The Population Table includes all the rows and columns from the Preceptor Table and from the data set, along with rows from the underlying population from which, we assume, both the Preceptor Table and the data have been drawn.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

There are three key issues to explore in any Population Table: stability, representativeness, and unconfoundedness.

### Exercise 2

Scenario: You are an analyst at the mayor's office and want to find out what it will take for people to be more kind towards immigrants. You have previous data regarding individuals who were exposed to one of two possible conditions, and then their attitudes towards immigrants were recorded. One condition was waiting on a train platform near individuals speaking Spanish. The other was being on a train platform without Spanish-speakers. You are going to use this data and conduct your own analysis. You will give speeches on citizens through random assignment that includes a positive message regarding immigrants. Your hope is that the causal effect of those speeches is to make people be kinder. 

### 

In one sentence, provide a reason why the assumption of stability might not hold. In the second sentence, explain how that failure might impact the results.

```{r cardinal-values-with-justice-2}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "The assumption of stability might not hold because the relationship with our data (Spanish speakers on a train platform) and Preceptor Table (a speech from the mayor about immigrants) are not similar enough. The relationship differs as the Spanish speakers on the train platform can influence the job works who may already be mad and the mayor's speech can influence the citizens in a great way because they want to be there.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

Stability assumes that the relationship between the outcome variable and the covariates remains consistent over time. It acknowledges the temporal nature of real-world data science problems and the assumption that the future will be similar to the past.

### Exercise 3

In one sentence, provide a reason why the assumption of representativeness might not hold. In the second sentence, explain how that failure might impact the results.

```{r cardinal-values-with-justice-3}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "The assumption of representatives might not hold because the sample of our data (Spanish speakers on a train platform) and Preceptor Table (a speech from the mayor about immigrants) are not random enough. The sample of the Spanish speakers on the train platform are tired job workers needing to go to work (can get easily annoyed) and the sample of the citizen's listening to the mayor's speech (can get easily be influenced because they are not forced to attend the meeting).",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

It is important for the data available to be representative of the population for which parameters need to be calculated. Random sampling from the population is ideal but often not feasible. Ensuring representativeness is crucial for drawing accurate inferences. Stability and representativeness are about the rows in our Population Table.

### Exercise 4

In one sentence, provide a reason why the assumption of unconfoundedness would hold.

```{r cardinal-values-with-justice-4}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "The assumption of unconfoundedness would hold because the sample of our data (Spanish speakers on a train platform) and Preceptor Table (a speech from the mayor about immigrants) are part of a causal model and we are randomly assigning treatment to the citizens.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

Unconfoundedness is related to the absence of confounding variables that may bias the relationship between the outcome variable and covariates. It implies that there are no hidden factors influencing both the treatment (if applicable) and the outcome.

### Exercise 5

Write a one-sentence summary explaining what is a *Data Generating Mechanism (DGM)*.

```{r cardinal-values-with-justice-5}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "DGM refers to the mathematical formula, including an error term, that relates the outcome variable to the covariates.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

*Justice* gave us the structure of the DGM. With a DGM, we can answer any question which we might have. In particular, with the DGM, we provide predictions of data we have not seen and estimates of the uncertainty associated with those predictions.

## Cardinal Virtues with Courage
### 

*Courage* allows us to explore different models. Even though *Justice* has provided the basic mathematical structure of the model, we still need to decide which variables to include and to estimate the values of unknown parameters. 

### Exercise 1

What is the significance of the *Posterior Probability Distributions*, explain in one sentence. 

```{r cardinal-virtues-with-courage-1}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "With posterior probability distributions, we can compare the actual values of the outcome variable with the “fitted” or “predicted” results of the model.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

Through Posterior Probability Distributions we are able to examine the “residuals,” the difference between the fitted and actual values.

### Exercise 2

In the first sentence write the equation for outcome. In the second sentence explain why we use this equation of outcome. 

Hint: The sum of two other elements.

```{r cardinal-virtues-with-courage-2}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "outcome = model + what is not in the model. We use the equation of outcome to view the potential outcomes that may arise with our model and the data we have not in our model.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

It doesn’t matter what the outcome is. It could be the result of a coin flip, the weight of a person, the GDP of a country. Whatever outcome we are considering is always made up of two parts. The first is the model we have created. The second is all the stuff — all the blooming and buzzing complexity of the real world — which is not a part of the model.

### Exercise 3

In one sentence, explain the definition of a *Parameter* and its uses in the Preceptor Table.

```{r cardinal-virtues-with-courage-3}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "A parameter is a mental abstraction or a building block used in statistical modeling to replace unknown values and help achieve the goal of replacing question marks in the actual Preceptor Table.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

A parameter is something which does not exist in the real world. (If it did, or could, then it would be data.) Since parameters are mental abstractions, we will always be uncertain as to their value, however much data we might collect.

## Cardinal Virtues with Temperance
### 

*Temperance* guides us in the use of the model we have created to answer the questions we began with. We create posteriors of quantities of interest. We should be modest in the claims we make. The posteriors we create are never the “truth.”

### Exercise 1

What is the definitions and difference between *Preceptor's Posterior* and *Estimated Posterior*, explain in one sentence.

```{r cardinal-virtues-with-temperan-1}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "Preceptor's Posterior represents the perfect, unknown true distribution, while the estimated posterior is a calculated approximation of that distribution based on available data and modeling assumptions.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

In Temperance, the key distinction is between the true posterior distribution — what we will call Preceptor’s Posterior — and the estimated posterior distribution. Sadly, even if our estimated posterior is, very close to Preceptor’s Posterior, we can never be sure of that fact, because we can never know the truth, never be certain that all the assumptions we made are correct.

### Exercise 2

What is the *Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference*? 

Hint: Look into chapter summary of [Rubin Causal Model](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/04-rubin-causal-model.html#summary)

```{r cardinal-virtues-with-temperan-2}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference is that it is impossible to observe the causal effect on a single unit because we can never observe both potential outcomes for that unit. We must make assumptions in order to estimate causal effects.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

## Summary
### 

This tutorial covered [Chapter 2: Probability](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/probability.html) of [*Preceptor’s Primer for Bayesian Data Science: Using the Cardinal Virtues for Inference*](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/) by [David Kane](https://davidkane.info/).  

After finishing this tutorial you should be able to:
  1. Use `list()` ,`map()`, `map_*()`, and `tibble()` functions.
  2. Use `tibble()`, `mutate()`,`map_*()`, `rep()` and `sample()` to generate data.
  3. Know about different types of distribution.
  4. Create distributions using tools above and from earlier chapters.
  5. Understand the meaning of each distribution by looking at each graph.
