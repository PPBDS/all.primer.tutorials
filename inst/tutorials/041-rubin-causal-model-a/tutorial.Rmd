<!-- Fix Causal vs predictive models has a typo. And fix the 2 taus table in the 2nd tutorial so that tau is easier to calculate mentally. --> 

<!-- Submit a PR for SZ's typos. -->

<!-- Get rid of all multiple choice questions. -->

<!-- How do we give students information about being wrong or right? Easy for code! -->

<!-- After the definitions, we could have some problems which use the actual train data, calculate some causal effects and then plot them. Lots of good staff there. First, assume a single tau. What is it? How sure are you? Then separate taus for men and women. Or some other grouping. Show facetted plot. -->

<!-- One question could take the trains data and make a Preceptor table. Learn a little gt! Would also need some manipulation to create the two potential outcome columns. -->

<!-- More about confounding. Of course, it needs to be in the book. -->

## Definitions
###

If you have read the chapter, then these questions should be easy.


### Exercise 1

In your own words, give a one sentence definition of a Preceptor Table.

```{r def-ex-1}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    options = list(nrows = 3))
```

###

Preceptor Table: Table (typically) with data missing, used to solve a problem/question.


### Exercise 2

In your own words, give a one sentence definition of a potential outcome.

```{r def-ex-2}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    options = list(nrows = 3))
```

###

Potential Outcome: A possible result of an action (Ex. Losing  $20 when gambling, or winning $20 dollars).

### Exercise 3

In your own words, give a one sentence definition of a causal effect.

```{r def-ex-3}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    options = list(nrows = 3))
```

###

Casual Effect: The difference between two outcomes on a Preceptor Table.  


### Exercise 4

Give a paragraph explanation about the Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference. Include an example relating to your own life.

```{r def-ex-4}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    options = list(nrows = 7))
```

###

The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference states that one possible outcome is always missing, and you can’t record all the possible scenarios. For example, for breakfast I can choose between eating cereal, or not eating cereal. In scenario A, I would eat the cereal and record the data for that action. However, since I can’t go back in time, I can’t record data for NOT eating cereal. Thus, there is always a possible outcome that can not be captured. 


### Exercise 5

In two sentences, explain what what an *ideal* Preceptor Table is, and why it is generally impossible to observe. Use the phrase "potential outcomes" in your answer.

```{r def-ex-5}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    options = list(nrows = 5))
```

###

An ideal Preceptor Table is a table that does not have any missing data. This table is generally seen as impossible since it means that you can observe all potential outcomes of a situation, which should be impossible due to the Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference. 


### Exercise 6

In one sentence, explain the difference between an *actual* Preceptor Table and an *ideal* Preceptor Table.

```{r def-ex-6}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    options = list(nrows = 3))
```

###

An actual Preceptor Table has missing values, whereas an ideal Preceptor Table doesn’t have any missing values. 

## Causal Effect
###

Use the following ideal Preceptor Table to answer some questions about potential estimands we might be interested in.

```{r}
gt_obj
```

### Exercises 1 to 3

```{r ce-ex-1}
quiz(

  question("What is the causal effect of the treatment on Yao?",
    answer("1"),
    answer("2"),
    answer("3"),
    answer("4", correct = TRUE),
    answer("5"),
    allow_retry = FALSE),

  question("For how many of the five people is the causal effect of the treatment positive?",
    answer("1"),
    answer("2"),
    answer("3", correct = TRUE),
    answer("4"),
    answer("5"),
    allow_retry = FALSE),

  question("On whom did the treatment have the most negative causal effect?",
    answer("Yao"),
    answer("Emma"),
    answer("Cassidy"),
    answer("Tahmid", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Diego"),
    allow_retry = FALSE)
)
```



## One tau
###

In these exercises, we will assume that the causal effect, $\tau$ (pronounced tau), is the same for everyone.


Use the following actual Preceptor Table to answer questions about a single value for tau.

```{r question-singletau-setup}
tibble(subject = c("Yao", "Emma", "Cassidy", "Tahmid", "Diego"),
       ytreat = c("13", "14", "?", "?", "3"),
       ycontrol = c("?", "?", "6", "12", "?"),
       ydiff = c("?", "?", "?", "?", "?")) %>%
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("ID"),
                ytreat = md("$$Y_t(u)$$"),
                ycontrol = md("$$Y_c(u)$$"),
                ydiff = md("$$Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)$$")) %>%
  cols_move(columns = c(ytreat, ycontrol), after = c(subject)) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = c(subject))) %>%
  tab_style(style = cell_text(align = "left", v_align = "middle", size = "large"), 
            locations = cells_column_labels(columns = c(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = everything()) %>%
  cols_align(align = "left", columns = c(subject)) %>%
  tab_spanner(label = "$$\\text{Outcomes}$$", c(ytreat, ycontrol)) %>%
  tab_spanner(label = "$$\\text{Estimand}$$", c(ydiff)) %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = everything())
```

### Exercise 1

Describe in one sentence/equation how you would estimate Yao's $Y_c(u)$. (Do not use actual numbers, use "tau" in your explanation).

```{r 1-tau-ex-1}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    options = list(nrows = 2))
```

###

Yao's $Y_t(u)$ - (Sum of all Values in $Y_t(u)$/Number of Values-Sum of all Values in $Y_c(u)$/Number of Values)


### Exercise 2

Describe in one sentence/equation how you would estimate Tahmids's $Y_t(u)$. (Do not use actual numbers, use "tau" in your explanation).

```{r 1-tau-ex-2}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    options = list(nrows = 2))
```

###

(Sum of all Values in $Y_t(u)$/Number of Values - Sum of all Values in $Y_c(u)$/Number of Values) + Tahmid's $Y_c(u)$

### Exercise 3

Describe in one sentence/equation how you would estimate a single value for tau.

```{r 1-tau-ex-3}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    options = list(nrows = 2))
```

###

(Sum of all Values in $Y_t(u)$/Number of Values - Sum of all Values in $Y_c(u)$/Number of Values)

### Exercises 4 to 6

```{r 1-tau-ex-4}
quiz(

  question("What is your estimate for a single value for tau?",
    answer("-2"),
    answer("2"),
    answer("1", correct = TRUE),
    answer("-1"),
    answer("1.5"),
    allow_retry = FALSE),

  question("What is your estimate for $Y_c(u)$ for Emma?",
    answer("10", correct = TRUE),
    answer("11"),
    answer("12"),
    answer("13"),
    answer("14"),
    allow_retry = FALSE),

  question("What is your estimate for $Y_t(u)$ for Cassidy?",
    answer("6"),
    answer("5"),
    answer("7", correct = TRUE),
    answer("9"),
    answer("8"),
    allow_retry = FALSE)
)
```
